//Numeric Promotion Rules:
//1. Two values with different data types, will be promoted to the larger data type
//2. One of the values is integral, the other is floating, java will automatically promote integral to floating point type
//3. Datatypes such as byte, short and char will be promoted to int first anytime they are used with arithmetic operator.
//4. The resulting value will have the same datatype as the type of the resulting  value.


//Java Operators with precedence
//Post unary  ++, --
//Pre unary ++, --
//Other unary +, -, !
//Multiply/Divide/Modulas *, /, %
//Add/Subtract +, -
//Relational operators <, <=, >, >=, instanceof, ==, !=
//Logical operators &, |, ^
//Short-circuit logical &&, ||
//Ternary ? :

//Switch statements accept:
//1. byte, short, int, char and their wrapper classes Byte, Short, Integer, Character
//2. enum added in Java 5
//3. String added in Java 7
//Values in case statement should be compile time constants.
