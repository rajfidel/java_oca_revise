## Revise Java OCA

Been more than 1 year since I gave and Passed my Java OCA exam. Signed up for the Java OCP exam. Have to take the exam some time in the next 3 months. Dont use Java at work, so a good way to start would be to revise the Java OCA syllabus during the next 1 week and quickly move to Java OCP.

Targets: 
1. April 16, 2017 -> Complete Java OCA Syllabus.
